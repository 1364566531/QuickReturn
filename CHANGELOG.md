# Version 1.1

* Added new ``QuickReturnAttacher`` and removed ``QuickReturnListView``. This way, users are not required to subclass a custom listView in order to user the lib.
* Added position argument to ``QuickReturnAttacher``, so now you can choose whether to use top or bottom quick return. **Note: Don't forget to set the view's gravity correctly according to the position chosen!**

# Version 1.0

Initial release.
